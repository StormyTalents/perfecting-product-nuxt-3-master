title: About Perfecting Product
---

### Designing product experiences that people love to use and drive business results can be hard.

Years of working with founders to understand users and create product experiences, we understand . 

Simply put, Perfecting Product exists to help companies perfect their product experience. But our idea of perfection might need a little more of an introduction.

The process people envision will improve their product experience varies a lot from person to person and stakeholder to stakeholder. And the way each person measures perfection varies as well.

We've found over years of working with software companies that despite differences in perspective that there are effective ways to measure the product experience and strive for its perfection by measuring our relative distance from it. 

By measuring product dissatisfaction, retention issues such as churn, irregularities in the frequency of product engagement, and lower software product pricing power relative to that of your peers, we identify and prioritize companies biggest product issues. 

We ensure our process is robust and creates meaningful outcomes for our clients by letting the evidence guide us and providing a narrowly focused service that avoids the typical problems found when UX research and product strategy services are delivered alone. 

The result is stronger product engagement and improved key user experience and business metrics such as reduced churn, increased referral rates, increased pricing power, and lower software development costs. 

The first principle of our company philosophy:

> "If you would like to improve something, first ask how you should measure it"

The first challenge we help software businesses overcome is measuring the product experience and understanding their users.
