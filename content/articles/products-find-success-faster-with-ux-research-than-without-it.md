## The Problem: 
### Skipping a usability testing process for new product features slows down product development by forcing software companies to rework their product and designs.
The biggest problem software companies face today is building product features before they've validated that the features and designs they're building are something people will enjoy using.

Building the wrong features costs companies something far more valuable than engineers, designers, and PMs: time.

Building the wrong product costs businesses their ability to innovate. Businesses need to support their existing products, so maintaining failing and flailing products sucks the life out of businesses by killing their momentum and draining human capital.

Building the wrong product drains employees' energy and has a material effect on your business.

## How the Problem Happens
### Building the Wrong Features
Another way you could describe building the wrong products is building the wrong features.

Building the wrong features primarily happens in two different ways: 

Firstly, companies build the wrong features for the right customers and users.

In this case, they identify the customers/users that they actually want, but either let their internal biases inform key product decisions or merely guess at what they need, neglecting to validate the needs of key stakeholders.

Secondly, companies build the right features for the wrong users/customers.

In this case, companies build features people want, but it doesn't create the business outcome they need to be profitable and sustain themselves.

When you build the wrong features for your ideal customers or users, you simply don't get traction. Acquisition is hard and churn is high. People don't show interest in your product and rather than provide negative feedback, you're met with lots of ambiguity and product demos that "went well", but actually go nowhere.

However, what's much worse is actually a result that's much more common: building features for users and customers you don't want, but that creates a sense of traction that distorts your business and hurts your product and brand positioning.

## The Results of Building Without Research Validation
### Huge Wasted Cost in Engineering and Customer Support
Engineering and customer support resources are not cheap.

Most companies overspend on engineering. Not because they're hiring the wrong talent or overpaying for them, but instead because their engineering team's talent is often misused to build products and implement features that have not been properly validated through research and testing.

### What happens when software companies focus on the wrong users
Missed profit opportunities, damage to your product's reputation, brand value, and increased price sensitivity that prevents you from charging what your worth.

Once companies have built the wrong software features it's difficult to not support an active and existing user base.

Users and customers have expectations just like anyone else and your brand immediately becomes associated with your ability to maintain the viability and quality of service from existing products.

It doesn't matter that the product you've built has gained a sense of traction that feel more like handcuffs than a golden-goose. Your business' reputation is now attached to it.

Abandoning a product can hurt your reputation even if the product no longer serves your business.

## The Solution
Avoid building the wrong features.

Identify what users you want and what features solve problems they have in a way that will be profitable and sustainable for you business. You accomplish this by doing user interviews and user testing. To ensure that people will actually use the product as you've designed it you then need to do usability testing that makes sure the product's interface is easy to use.

By validating the key assumptions about how people will use your product you ensure the product you build will deliver value to customers, return customer lifetime value to you, and will attract the types of users and usage that don't hurt your brand and product's positioning.
