If there’s anything we’ve learned from the immediate aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, it’s that the United States is woefully unequipped to measure Election Day voting outcomes.

Despite being a technology hub for the rest of the world, the United States failed to count its presidential Election Day results within several days of voting in its most important election.

Although this year’s pandemic response measures presented special challenges to vote-counting efforts, the United States still lags behind many other countries who have adopted modern-day solutions.

Citizens of the United States and every other democracy deserve fair and secure elections. People deserve modern-day solutions that build on proven solutions leading technology companies currently use at scale.

Citizens deserve secure and transparent vote-counting software. It’s never been more important to secure the vote than now when social media exercises tremendous influence and is less transparent and accountable than ever.
